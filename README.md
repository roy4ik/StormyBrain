https://stormybrain.herokuapp.com/

In times where people are working remotely without directly beign able to interact brain storming has become harder than ever. 
This is why I have created StormyBrain! Stormy brain takes the heavy lifting of brainstorming away from you and allows you to reduce time spent brainstorming by providing your with suggestions of related words and topics as well as benefit from the brainstorms of other users by taking these in account when generating suggestions for you!
